          <p className='pb-10 text-xl font-medium text-gray-600'>Welcome to my portfolio!! My name is Yuta Asai, and I am a dedicated Web Developer with a passion for crafting engaging, efficient, and innovative web solutions. Originally from Japan, I am currently based in Vancouver Canada. While I have no professional experience in this field yet, I am motivated by a passion for knowledge and a genuine curiosity for coding.</p>
          <p className='pb-10 text-xl font-medium text-gray-600'>I majored in Software Development at College in Canada, where I was introduced to programming languages and the desire to learn more about programming and be able to develop as well, which is how I got my foot in the door of web development. I am familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks such as React and TypeScript. I am especially drawn to projects using React. I feel I can best use my creativity and technical skills there.
